# LumiPod Vision — One‑Click Static PWA (No Build)
Drag‑and‑drop this folder (or the ZIP) into Netlify **Deploys**. No `npm install`, no `node_modules`, no build.

## Features
- Installable PWA (manifest + service worker)
- Offline support (cache‑first)
- Simple LumiPod‑style pet with Feed / Play / Rest
- Single‑file deploy: works with Netlify drag‑and‑drop

## Netlify
- If using Git deploy later, you can keep this static version (no build).
- `netlify.toml` included to set correct headers and SW scope.

## Local test
Just open `index.html` or run a static server.
